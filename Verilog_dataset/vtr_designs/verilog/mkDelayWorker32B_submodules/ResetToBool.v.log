Generating RTLIL representation for module `\ResetToBool'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/mkDelayWorker32B_submodules/ResetToBool.v:36.1-42.4 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.
