-- Executing script file `out.ys' --

1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/final_out.v
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `/home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/final_out.v' to AST representation.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\final_out'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/final_out.v:29.3-38.6 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.
Successfully finished Verilog frontend.

root of   0 design levels: final_out           
Automatically selected final_out as design top module.

2.2. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \final_out

2.3. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \final_out
Removed 0 unused modules.

Removed a total of 0 dead cases.

3.3. Executing PROC_PRUNE pass (remove redundant assignments in processes).
Removed 0 redundant assignments.
Promoted 1 assignment to connection.

Creating decoders for process `\final_out.$proc$/home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/final_out.v:29$1'.
     1/3: $1\output_z[15:0] [15]
     2/3: $1\output_z[15:0] [14:10]
     3/3: $1\output_z[15:0] [9:0]

3.7. Executing PROC_DLATCH pass (convert process syncs to latches).
No latch inferred for signal `\final_out.\output_z' from process `\final_out.$proc$/home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/final_out.v:29$1'.

3.8. Executing PROC_DFF pass (convert process syncs to FFs).

3.9. Executing PROC_MEMWR pass (convert process memory writes to cells).
