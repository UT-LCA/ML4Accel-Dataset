## Overview

![FlowGNN overall architecture](https://github.com/sharc-lab/FlowGNN/blob/56ea0add932daad2e16c08704d91c8a9a7d777ed/images/arch-overall.svg)

This is **FlowGNN**, a generic dataflow architecture for GNN acceleration which can flexibly support the majority of message-passing GNNs. [Read the paper on arXiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13103)
